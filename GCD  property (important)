Properties of GCD (Greatest Common Divsior)

( For LCM just use a/GCD(a,b)*b )

Important observation:
1. GCD extract common structure
2 divsion isolate damage. ex: if a divides b then its means all prime factors of a consist in or present in b.
lets say a doesn't divides b so all prime factors are not present in b. so using divide we can find that prime factor which does not present in b of a 
suppose its x. formula: x=a/GCD(a,b) ex 18/6=> x = > 18/(GCD(18,6) => 18/6 => 3 means 3 is the prime factor of 18 which does'nt present in 6
3 . LCM merge indepentend constrants.

1 . gcd(a,0) = |a| explain : so  every number is a multiple of 0 and a largest divisor of a then greatest common divisor is : a (sign does nt matter)

2. gcd(a,b) = gcd(|a|,|b|) sign does'nt matter

3.  if a divides b (b%a=0) then gcd(a,b) = a ( if a divides b then a<b and max common divisor can be upto smallest one but a divide b so gcd is a)

4 . gcd(a,b) = gcd(a-b,b) where a>=b
explain : suppose we have number d which divides both a and b 
therefore: a/d and b/d
so: a = d*n (n-> something number which is multiply by d to make a)
  and b= d*m example 6/2 2 can divide 6 so we can write 6 =2*3 which is nothing but 2*(somenumber) became 6 (simple math)

so a-b  = d(n-m) so d also divide a-b from property 3 we know if d divides a and a-b then there have same common divisor

5. Every common divisor divides the gcd 
Explain: a=24 and b = 36
          and common divisors are: (1,2,4,6,12) and gcd is 12 so all common divisors are less than 12 and divided 12

6. GCD as a linear combination
    gcd(a,b) can be written as smallest positive integers of combination of ax+by = gcd(a,b) (Bezout's theorem/ identity)
    example: a=30 , b=18
      gcd(30,18) = 30*1+18*-1 = 18

7. gcd(m.a,m.b) = m.gcd(a,b) (Scaleing property)

  importance:

  if gcd(a,b) = g then gcd(a/g,b/g) = 1 (they became co-prime)

8 . adding multiple of b in doesn't change the gcd

    gcd(a,b) = gcd(a+m*b,b) (it doesn't change common structure)

9. Eucliden identity

  gcd(a,b) = gcd(b,a%b)

10 . gcd(a,1) = 1

11. gcd is multplicative ( but when a and b are coprime)

  gcd(a1*a2,b) = gcd(a1,b)*gcd(a2,b)

12 . gcd(a,b) = gcd(b,a)

13 . gcd(a,gcd(b,c)) = gcd(gcd(a,b),c)

  used for gcd of arr and in prefix and suffix gcd

14. gcd(a,lcm(b,c)) = lcm(gcd(a,b),gcd(a,c))

15. Geometric interpitation 
  On a grid, the number of integer point on the line is from (0.0) to (a,b) is gcd(a,b)+1

16. Gcd of arithmetic progression :
 for seq : a,a+d,a+2d,a+3d,a+4d.....
  gcd = gcd(a,d)

17. gcd of factorial

  GCD(n!,m!) = min(n,m)! ex: GCD(3!,5!) = 3!

18. gcd of powers
  gcd(a^x,b^y) = gcd(a,b)^min(x,y)
  for a and b are shared prime
